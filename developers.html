                <p class="paragraph">Hello, my name is Aayush Singh. Currently, I am 15 years old and just passed 9th
                    grade. On this team, I am designated the team manager and lead game tester. My responsibilities for
                    these roles are to coordinate the team, distribute tasks and due dates, in addition to thoroughly
                    testing the game. In addition to this, I help out wherever possible from documentation portfolio, to
                    coding, to sprites and animations. This is my first year doing TSA, and I have already learnt so
                    much. I have learned a lot about leading a team and the importance of teamwork, as well as time
                    management. TSA pushed me to become a more effective leader. The part I enjoy the most about TSA is
                    seeing our final product come together. From the countless hours we have spent together, seeing all
                    the pieces fit together into a well-rounded videogame is incredibly rewarding, showing a testament
                    of our progress and work. Outside of TSA, I enjoy playing basketball, web development, and meeting
                    new people.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Hi, my name is Neel Casula. I am 15 years old and just completed 9th grade. On the
                    team, I have contributed by being the lead artist, in addition to the secondary game developer. I
                    have specifically helped my making a majority of the towers, viruses, and level screens, in addition
                    to making the code for interacting with the towers. As this is my first year competing in TSA, I
                    have learnt a lot about things such as time management, researching effectively, and debugging
                    issues. Being a part of TSA has shaped me into a stronger person. My favorite part of TSA is seeing
                    how far we have come, all the changes we have made, and all the new people we have met. Aside from
                    TSA, I enjoy playing tennis, hanging out with friends, and learning new things. I love designing and
                    engineering products, as well as writing code to solve problems.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Hello, my name is Ajay Prem and I’m a 15-year-old rising sophomore. On our TSA
                    team, I served as the primary game developer. My role involved learning how to program enemies to
                    appear and move along the track, as well as designing towers with specialized abilities like
                    attacking, slowing, and upgrading. This was my first year participating in TSA, and I gained a wide
                    range of skills, both technical and personal, that have helped me grow. One of my favorite parts of
                    TSA is presenting our final product. It’s incredibly rewarding to see all the hard work come
                    together and feel proud of what we’ve accomplished. Outside of TSA, I enjoy weightlifting, spending
                    time with my family and friends, and exploring topics in STEM.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Hi, my name is Ishaan and im a rising sophomore at the Downingtown STEM Academy. In
                    my free time, i enjoy playing basketball, doing robotics, working out, and hanging out with my
                    friends. For this project, I primarily focused on the documentation, which included working on our
                    documentation portfolio by utilizing the engineering design process, and also creating our
                    storyboard which sufficed as a blueprint for the project. Overall, TSA has helped me become a more
                    well rounded individual, as I learned more about technology, while learning collaboration skills
                    with my peers. The various events offered are very unique and offer rigorous work that challenges
                    intellectual stimulation, and they are related to technology, which is a passion of mine. I hope to
                    continue to grow and expand my horizons through TSA.</p>
